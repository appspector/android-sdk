With AppSpector you can remotely debug your app running in the same room or on another continent. 
You can measure app performance, view database content, logs, network requests and many more in realtime. 
This is the instrument that you've been looking for. Don't limit yourself only to simple logs. 
Debugging doesn't have to be painful!

# Setup

## 1. Create App
Each app you want to use with AppSpector SDK you have to register on the web (https://app.appspector.com).
After adding the application navigate to app settings and copy API key.

## 2. Add AppSpector SDK to your build.gradle

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
      maven {
          url "https://maven.appspector.com/artifactory/android-sdk"
      }
  }
  
  dependencies {
      classpath "com.appspector:android-sdk-plugin:latest_version"
  }
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
// Put AppSpector plugin after Android plugin
apply plugin: 'com.appspector.sdk'

repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://maven.appspector.com/artifactory/android-sdk"
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation "com.appspector:android-sdk:latest_version"
}
```

## 3. Initialize AppSpector SDK

```java
import android.app.Application;

import com.appspector.sdk.AppSpector;

public class AmazingApp extends Application {

   @Override
   public void onCreate() {
      super.onCreate();
      
      // We recommend to start AppSpector from Application#onCreate method
      AppSpector
            .build(this)
            .addPerformanceMonitor()
            .addHttpMonitor()
            // If specific monitor is not added then this kind of data won't be tracked and available on the web
            .addLogMonitor()
            .addScreenshotMonitor()
            .addSQLMonitor()
            .run("#APP_API_KEY#");
   }

}
```
