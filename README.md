With AppSpector you can remotely debug your app running in the same room or on another continent. 
You can measure app performance, view database content, logs, network requests and many more in realtime. 
This is the instrument that you've been looking for. Don't limit yourself only to simple logs. 
Debugging doesn't have to be painful!

# Setup

## 1. Create App
Each app you want to use with AppSpector SDK you have to register on the web (https://app.appspector.com).
After adding the application navigate to app settings and copy API key.

## 2. Add AppSpector SDK to your build.gradle
<!-- integration-manual-start -->
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/appspector/android-sdk.svg)](https://github.com/appspector/android-sdk)

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
      maven {
          jcenter()
          google()
          url "https://maven.appspector.com/artifactory/android-sdk"
      }
  }
  
  dependencies {
      classpath "com.appspector:android-sdk-plugin:1.0.2"
  }
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
// Put AppSpector plugin after Android plugin
apply plugin: 'com.appspector.sdk'

repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://maven.appspector.com/artifactory/android-sdk"
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation "com.appspector:android-sdk:1.0.2"
}
```
<!-- integration-manual-end -->

## 3. Initialize AppSpector SDK
<!-- initialization-manual-start -->
```java
import android.app.Application;

import com.appspector.sdk.AppSpector;

public class AmazingApp extends Application {

   @Override
   public void onCreate() {
      super.onCreate();
      
      // We recommend to start AppSpector from Application#onCreate method
      
      // You can start all monitors
      AppSpector
            .build(this)
            .withDefaultMonitors()            
            .run("API_KEY");
            
      // Or you can select monitors that you want to use
      AppSpector
            .build(this)
            .addPerformanceMonitor()
            .addHttpMonitor()
            // If specific monitor is not added then this kind of data won't be tracked and available on the web
            .addLogMonitor()
            .addScreenshotMonitor()
            .addSQLMonitor()
            .run("API_KEY");
   }

}
```
<!-- initialization-manual-end -->

## 4. Build and Run

Build your project and see everything work! When your app is up and running you can go to https://app.appspector.com and connect to your application session.

# Features
AppSpector provides many monitors that tracks different activities inside your app:

#### SQLite monitor
Provides browser for sqlite databases found in your app. Allows to track all queries, shows DB scheme and data in DB. You can issue custom SQL query on any DB and see results in browser immediately.

#### HTTP monitor
Shows all HTTP traffic in your app. You can examine any request, see request/response headers and body.
We provide XML and JSON highliting for request/responses with formatting and folding options so even huge responses are easy to look through.

#### Logs monitor
Displays all logs generated by your app.

#### Location monitor
Most of the apps are location-aware. Testing it requires changing locations yourself. In this case, location mocking is a real time saver. Just point to the location on the map and your app will change its geodata right away.

#### Performance monitor
Displays real-time graphs of the CPU / Memory / Network / Disk / Battery usage.

#### Screenshot monitor
Simply captures screenshot from the device.
